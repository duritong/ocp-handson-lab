  OpenShift HandsOn

<h1>OpenShift Hands on Lab</h1>

<p>This tutorial gives you a basic overview on OpenShift and guides you through the various features.</p>

<p>The idea is to go through the tutorial from the beginning to the end.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>All you need to do this tutorial is a modern Webbrowser that is able to connect to the Lab environment.</p>

<h2>Connecting</h2>

<p>As a first step we are trying to make sure you are able to connect to the console, that serves as a graphical user-interface for OpenShift.</p>

<p>We recommend you to keep this tutorial open in a browser tab, while opening a new tab with the console at the following URL <a href="https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp001.rhlab.ch">https://console-openshift-console.apps.ocp001.rhlab.ch</a>.</p>

<p>When connecting, you will have to authenticate using the username you got handed out at the beginning of the labs.</p>

<p>Use this username and password to authenticate with the <code>IDP_NAME</code> identity provider. When being offerered to &ldquo;Log in with&rdquo; choose the <code>HtPasswd-demo</code> option and afterwards your username and password.</p>

<p>After login you are prompted by a short guide through the most important parts of the UI - we recommend you to quickly step through it.</p>

<h2>Getting familiar</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s inspect the different views by trying to find answers for the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What projects / namespaces are around?</li>
<li>What is running in these namespaces?</li>
</ul>


<p>To make things a bit more interesting, we have given you read access to the namespaces, that hosts this tutorial.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you tell us how many instances are running of the handson tutorial app?</li>
<li>Can you tell us how much CPU / memory it uses?</li>
<li>Can you tell us who accesses the handson tutorial app?</li>
</ul>


<p>There is also a centralized UI for log inspection, which allows you give an aggregated view over the logs from that pod. Can you find it?</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>
