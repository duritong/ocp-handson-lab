<h1>OpenShift Hands on Lab</h1>

<p>This tutorial gives you a basic overview on OpenShift and guides you through the various features.</p>

<p>The idea is to go through the tutorial from the beginning to the end.</p>

<h2>Requirements</h2>

<p>All you need to do this tutorial is a modern Webbrowser that is able to connect to the Lab environment.</p>

<h2>Connecting</h2>

<p>As a first step we are trying to make sure you are able to connect to the console, that serves as a graphical user-interface for OpenShift.</p>

<p>We recommend you to keep this tutorial open in a browser tab, while opening a new tab with the console at the following URL <a href="https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-xx657.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io">https://console-openshift-console.apps.cluster-xx657.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io</a>.</p>

<p>When connecting, you will have to authenticate using the username you got handed out at the beginning of the labs.</p>

<p>Use this username and password to authenticate with the cluster.</p>

<p>After login you are prompted by a short guide through the most important parts of the UI - we recommend you to quickly step through it.</p>

<h2>Getting familiar</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s inspect the different views by trying to find answers for the following questions:</p>

<ul>
<li>What projects / namespaces are around?</li>
<li>What is running in these namespaces?</li>
</ul>


<p>To make things a bit more interesting, we have given you read access to the namespace, that hosts this tutorial.</p>

<ul>
<li>Can you tell us how many instances are running of the &ldquo;handson-tutorial&rdquo; app?</li>
<li>Can you tell us how much CPU / memory it uses?</li>
<li>Can you tell us who accesses the &ldquo;handson-tutorial&rdquo; app?</li>
</ul>


<p>There is also a centralized UI for log inspection, which allows you give an aggregated view over the logs from that pod. Can you find it?</p>

<h3>Task</h3>

<p>Can you create a new project called <code>userXY-webui</code> in the UI? Where XY is the number of your user. Over the whole tutorial we will reference with userXY to this, pay attention when entering / copying commands.</p>

<p>Give it meaningful Display Name and Desc    ription.</p>

<p>Tip: You can get a list of projects, this is also where you can create them.</p>

<h2>Use the cli</h2>

<p>All the operations within the webinterface are API calls to the standard Kubernetes API. OpenShift extends this API with a set of aditional APIs that provide OpenShift specific features. Such as Routes, Builds, etc.</p>

<p>You can talk to the API using the kubernetes native client <code>kubectl</code> or the OpenShift specific branded version of it, called <code>oc</code>.</p>

<p>To give you an easy way to access the cli, OpenShift ships with a built-in web-based Terminal, that allows you to directly execute commands against the API using your account.</p>

<p>You can start such a Terminal with on the <code>&gt;_</code> Symbol in the top menu bar on the right hand side. When starting your terminal the first time, you have to choose a base namespace / project with write access to it, that will host the terminal application for you. When you initially launch the terminal the first time, you are asked for a project to host the terminal. Create an extra project for it called: <code>userXY-terminal</code>.</p>

<p>The first time you start a terminal it might take a while. Once initialized it will launch much quicker.</p>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s get familiar with the cli and once the terminal got launched, type:</p>

<pre><code> oc whoami
</code></pre>

<h3>Getting help</h3>

<p>The oc cli features a help output, as well as more detailed help for each command:</p>

<pre><code> oc help
 oc projects -h
 oc projects
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>TAB</code> to autocomplete a command you are currently typing. The autocompletion can also query the API to autocomplete on deployed workload, like your project or pod-name.</p>

<h3>Create a new project on the cli</h3>

<p>Create a project called <code>userXY-cli</code> - Projects or also called namespaces (the Kubernetes representation) are a way to organize, administrate and compartinalize your resource within kubernetes.</p>

<p>You can get help by</p>

<pre><code> oc new-project -h
</code></pre>

<p>To create your new project you can do:</p>

<pre><code> oc new-project userXY-cli
</code></pre>

<p>We are immediately switched to our project:</p>

<pre><code> oc project
</code></pre>

<p>We can inspect our project by either describing it or getting a yaml (or json) formatted output of our created project.</p>

<pre><code> oc describe project userXY-cli
 oc get project userXY-webui -o yaml
 oc get project userXY-webui -o json
</code></pre>

<h3>Inspecting and editing other resources</h3>

<p>Everything within Openshift (Kubernetes) is represented as a resource, which we can view and depending on our privileges edit.</p>

<p>You can get for example all pods of your current project, by typing:</p>

<pre><code> oc get pods
</code></pre>

<p>You can also get all pods in a different namespace:</p>

<pre><code> oc get pods -n handson-tutorial
</code></pre>

<p>It is also possible to describe resources to get a more readable format:</p>

<pre><code> oc project handson-tutorial
 oc describe buildconfig handson-tutorial
</code></pre>

<p>The first command changes your context to the <code>handson-tutorial</code> project, then second command describes the resource <code>BuildConfig</code> called <code>handson-tutorial</code></p>

<p>You can also edit them:</p>

<pre><code> oc edit resourceXY resourceName
</code></pre>

<p>For example let&rsquo;s edit the buildconfig</p>

<pre><code> oc edit buildconfig handson-tutorial
</code></pre>

<p>This was only an example and you do not have write permissions to that resource anyway.</p>

<p>Do exit the editor by typing: <em>ESC</em> and <em>:</em> and <em>q</em></p>

<h3>How are my resources doing?</h3>

<p>You can always get an overview of your current resources by typing:</p>

<pre><code> oc status
</code></pre>

<p>This will become handy, once we start deploying more things.</p>

<h2>Deployment</h2>

<p>Now let&rsquo;s deploy our own application. We recommend you to use the cli in the webterminal for the next steps.</p>

<p>First we need a project to deploy our application into:</p>

<pre><code> oc new-project userXY-app
</code></pre>

<p>We have prepared a little demo application that is easy to deploy:</p>

<pre><code> oc new-app -n userXY-app registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ruby-30:latest~https://github.com/duritong/ocp-handson-lab/ --context-dir=app/
</code></pre>

<p>This will create a new application as well as starts a build of the application. You can follow the build using:</p>

<pre><code> oc logs -f buildconfig/ocp-handson-lab
</code></pre>

<p>Building an application might take a while&hellip;</p>

<p><img src="/compiling.png" alt="Compiling" /></p>

<p>Once finished you can verify your new app, either in the topology view or through the following commands:</p>

<pre><code> oc get deployment
 oc get pods
 oc status
</code></pre>

<p>BUT what is your application doing? It serves some content, to make this content accessible, we can create a <code>Route</code>:</p>

<pre><code>oc create route edge --service=ocp-handson-lab --insecure-policy=Redirect
</code></pre>

<p>Once create you can get the hostname either via cli:</p>

<pre><code>oc describe route ocp-handson-lab
</code></pre>

<p>Or in the topology view in the webinterface where you now should have a link on your running application.</p>

<p>The application provides several URLs:</p>

<ul>
<li>/ - the main entry point</li>
<li>/lobster - inspect</li>
<li>/health - just returning the healthiness of the application</li>
<li>/metrics - some metrics</li>
</ul>


<p>Inspect these URLs.</p>

<p>Can you also connect to a shell into the Pod of the deployed application? What is going on in there?</p>

<pre><code>oc rsh &lt;pod name&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>What else can you tell us about the deployed application by inspecting its resources?</p>

<h2>Self-Healing and scaling</h2>

<p>An important feature of Kubernetes is that it tries really hard to keep your application running. Let&rsquo;s look into that a bit:</p>

<p>We can easily query all the pods from our application deployment:</p>

<pre><code>oc project userY-app
oc get pods -l deployment=ocp-handson-lab
</code></pre>

<p>This filters all the pods with the label <code>deployment=ocp-handson-lab</code>.</p>

<p>We can also use this to delete the pods:</p>

<pre><code>oc delete pod -l deployment=ocp-handson-lab
</code></pre>

<p>Watch what is happening in the <code>Topology</code> view or re-query the current running pods:</p>

<pre><code>oc get pods -l deployment=ocp-handson-lab
</code></pre>

<p>Re-check the Pod Name when you visit the application.</p>

<p>Now we can also launch much more pods for our application, making it more re-silient to failure of individual instances, as well as to absorb more load:</p>

<pre><code>oc scale deployment/ocp-handson-lab --replicas=10
</code></pre>

<p>What happens to the pods? What happens in the topology view when you delete these pods?</p>

<h3>More fun</h3>

<p>We can also do these things with a different mechanism that makes much more fun.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s play at <a href="https://kubeinvaders.apps.cluster-xx657.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io">https://kubeinvaders.apps.cluster-xx657.dynamic.redhatworkshops.io</a></p>

<h2>Configuring the Application</h2>

<p>The application we deployed can return a different string than the current os-release file content. For that you can place a file in the container at <code>/config/content.txt</code> - This will be returned as part of the default webpage.</p>

<p>In kubernetes ConfigMaps are handy for that, this allows you to configure additional data through the Kubernetes API that is then injected into the container over different means.</p>

<p>First let&rsquo;s create a ConfigMap:</p>

<pre><code>cat &gt;configmap.yaml&lt;&lt;EOF
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: file-content
data:
  content.txt: Random Content
EOF

oc apply -n userXY-app -f configmap.yaml
</code></pre>

<p>Set Random Content to whatever you like to get.</p>

<p>No we need to edit the deployment to include configmap as a volume:</p>

<pre><code>oc edit -n userXY-app deployment ocp-handson-lab
</code></pre>

<p>Add the following sections:</p>

<pre><code># after terminationMessagePolicy: File
        volumeMounts:
        - name: config
          mountPath: "/config"
          readOnly: true

# after terminationGracePeriodSeconds
      volumes:
      - name: config
        configMap:
          name: file-content
</code></pre>

<p>Afterwards the trigger will automaticall restart the deployed application.</p>

<p>When changing the config map you need to restart the pod.</p>
